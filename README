# Multi-Slice Clustering Extension

This code implement the extension of the Multi-Slice clustering algorithm [1]. Our algorithm is called MSC-Extension, aims to extract the different clusters of slices that lie in the different subspaces from the data if the dataset is a sum of r rank-one tensor (r > 0). Our algorithm uses the
same input hyperparameter as the MSC algorithm.

* The MSC deliver the two clusters as a single cluster
* The MSC-Extension is able to separate these two clusters
